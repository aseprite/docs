# Tablet

As of Aseprite version 1.2.19.1, you can select which Windows
application programming interface (API) you prefer.

![Tablet section](tablet/tablet.png)

* *Windows 8/10 Pointer API*: The newer option from Microsoft, this
  should suffice for most modern devices.
* *[Wintab](wintab.md)*: This option is present to support pressure
  sensitivity on older devices and operating systems (Windows Vista/7).
* *Wintab (direct packet processing)*: This option aims to minimize
  packet loss and to create smoother strokes. It might not work well
  in some devices.

Pressing the *OK*/*Apply* buttons will change the tablet settings
immediately. There is no need to restart Aseprite.
