# Tablet

Since Windows 8, Microsoft introduced a new API to use your tablet
with Windows program: the pointer API. Since Aseprite v1.2.19.1 you
can configure what API do you prefer to use:

![Tablet section](tablet/tablet.png)

* *Windows 8/10 Pointer API*: This option might be enough for most
  modern devices, you can give a try how your tablet works with this
  (might work better with this option than with Wintab)
* *[Wintab](wintab.md)*: This is the default option at the moment to
  support pressure sensitivity on older systems (Windows Vista/7) and
  older devices.
* *Wintab (direct packet processing)*: This option might not work well
  in some devices, but might be useful in other devices to avoid
  losing packets and getting smoother strokes.

Pressing the *OK*/*Apply* buttons will change the tablet settings
immediately, there is no need to restart the program.
